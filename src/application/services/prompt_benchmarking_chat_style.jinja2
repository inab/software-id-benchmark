### Task: Software Metadata Verification

I am integrating software metadata from multiple sources. I have two metadata entries that may or may not belong to the same software.

Your task is to compare one entry against the other and determine whether they refer to the same tool.

### Input Format

You will receive inputs in **multiple parts**. Each part may include:

- JSON-formatted metadata for a software tool
- Extracted content from the tool’s repository (e.g., README files) or webpage (e.g., HTML, project descriptions). **These contents are provided explicitly because you do not have internet access.** Treat all provided content as final and in-scope. Do not assume any external URLs can be accessed.

The two tools are introduced as:
- `"The first software metadata_entry"` 
- `"The second software metadata_entry"` 

### Processing Instructions

1. Compare the metadata of each tool, prioritizing:
   - repository URLs
   - webpages
   - descriptions
   - documentation content (e.g., README)
   - authorship or contact info
   - associated publications or citations

2. **IMPORTANT**: The tool names are often the same across entries. This is expected and should **not be used alone** to decide if they refer to the same software.

3. Carefully analyze the provided repository or webpage content. Look for:
   - Link similarity (e.g., GitHub, SourceForge)
   - Shared or related descriptions
   - Overlapping contributors, emails, or institutions
   - Common citations or programming languages
   - Usage instructions or tool behavior that match

4. Wait until the final message says:

   **"All parts have been sent. Please now analyze the entries and provide the output as specified."**

Only then should you perform the analysis.

5. Your response must be a Python dictionary with the following keys:
   - `verdict`: one of `"Same"`, `"Different"`, or `"Unclear"`
   - `explanation`: 2–3 sentences explaining your decision, based only on the provided data
   - `confidence`: one of `"high"`, `"medium"`, or `"low"`
   - `features`: a list of metadata features you relied on (e.g., `"repo match"`, `"shared authors"`)

Do not use generic templates or placeholder text. Your answer must reflect the actual input.

### Output Format

Use this structure for your answer:

```python
{
  "verdict": "<Same | Different | Unclear>",
  "explanation": "<brief reasoning based on the actual data>",
  "confidence": "<high | medium | low>",
  "features": ["<feature1>", "<feature2>", "..."]
}
```
